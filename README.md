## Milestone 2


###  Task 1: Setting up virtual Machine

Steps:

Choose a Cloud Provider: Select a cloud provider (such as Microsoft Azure) to create a Virtual Machine (VM).

Create a Virtual Machine Instance:

the VM size for this project was 16gb, 
region chosen for this project was UKSouth, and operating system (Windows or Linux).

Set up networking (assign a public IP, configure security groups, etc.).

Install any necessary tools (such as SSH for Linux VMs).


### Task 2: Connecting Virtual Machine


Access the VM:

Use SSH (for Linux) or Remote Desktop (for Windows) to connect to the VM. I choose to connect my VM through Remote Desktop because i used windows VM operating system for this project.

Ensure proper firewall rules to allow SQL Server traffic.
